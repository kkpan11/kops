## Release notes for kOps 1.30 series

# Significant changes

## Version updates

kOps 1.30 adds support for kubernetes 1.30, and updates of most of the built-in components.

This release also updates to the next generation AWS SDK (aws-sdk-go-v2), though we do not expect
user-visible changes from this update.

## Improved support for Azure

kOps on Azure has been significantly improved in this release.

## Embedded asset hashes

Hashes for many kubernetes assets have been embedded into the kOps binary.  When using
a well-known asset, we no longer need to download the hash from a well-known location,
which slightly speeds up kOps cluster creation, and also creates a stronger chain-of-trust.
